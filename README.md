# Hannah Moss's Personal Website
This project is for a close friend's personal portfolio website. 

I wanted to focus on making another portfolio website like for the FreeCodeCamp challenges, but in a real environment, for someone's actual, real-life use. Because it's for a friend, I made sure to look at all the details and that everything works as it should. For my own portfolio project, I quit before I bashed out all the alignment details, since I had fulfilled all the criteria.
