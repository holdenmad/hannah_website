# Hannah Moss's Personal Website
This project is for a close friend's personal portfolio website. 

I wanted to focus on making another portfolio website like for the FreeCodeCamp challenges, but in a real environment, for someone's actual, real-life use. Because it's for a friend, I made sure to look at all the details and that everything works as it should. For my own portfolio project, I quit before I bashed out all the alignment details, since I had fulfilled all the criteria. 

## Skills I learned from this project:
- Flex display for making a gallery
- Obtimizing background-images
- Cropping images in CSS
- Limits of customization of images in CSS/when to just use Gimp instead
- Parallax effect
- Testing mobile versions on actual devices
- Problems with fixed/absolute images on mobile
- Obtaining free icons and crediting appropriately
- A bit more about media queries

## Skills to work on next time
- Media queries!
- Flex-box
- Grids
- PHP contact forms
-
